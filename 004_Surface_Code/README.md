# Surface Code

# Objective
- Understand the Surface Code, a topological error correction code that uses a two-dimensional lattice of qubits to encode logical qubits.
- It has a high error correction threshold and is considered one of the most promising techniques for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing.
- The surface code is used by the [Azure Quantum Resource Estimator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/overview-resources-estimator#quantum-error-correction-schemes).
