# Shor Code

# Objective
- Understand the Shor Code, The first quantum error correction code, developed by Peter Shor. It encodes one logical qubit into nine physical qubits.
- Shor code can correct one-bit flip error or one phase flip error, but it can't correct both types of errors at the same time.
