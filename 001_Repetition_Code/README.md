# Repetition Code (Three-qubit Error Correction Code)

# Objective
- Understand the steps for Repetition Code, the simplest quantum error correction code, where a single qubit is encoded into multiple qubits by repeating it multiple times.

# Overview
1) Repetition Code (X Error)

2) Repetition Code (Z Error)

# To do
- Fill the blank of the code.

# Getting Started
- $ python main.py

# Hint
- It can detect and correct single bit flip error.
- If you want to correct single phase flip error, add a Hadamard gate.
- It encodes a single logical qubit into three physical qubits by repeating the qubit three times.
